Interactive session: User can use escape sequence to modify some settings

Date_begin    datetime for beginning. No end defaults to year9999
Date_end      datetime for end. No beginning defaults to year 0000 (or equivalent)
        AND the date query to the rest.

mode          OR or AND the terms.

result size   How many results should be printed for a given query.


AND and OR are parsed by the query parser as well. So really this isn't bad at all.

Just need to figure out what the interface will be and how to integrate the historical data.
